Hierarchical Clustering for Text Analysis

This project demonstrates how to perform hierarchical clustering on text data using R. The project involves text preprocessing, creating a term-document matrix, and clustering text comments into meaningful groups. This technique is useful for understanding patterns and topics in text datasets, such as user reviews or survey responses.

 Project Overview

This project clusters textual comments into groups based on their semantic similarity. It uses hierarchical clustering methods to identify topics or patterns within the text data. The steps include:
	1.	Text preprocessing (e.g., normalization, removing stopwords).
	2.	Creating Document-Term and Term-Document matrices.
	3.	Weighting terms using TF-IDF.
	4.	Applying hierarchical clustering to group similar text data.

This approach is ideal for analyzing user-generated content, such as app reviews or feedback, to uncover trends and key topics.

Features

	•	Text Preprocessing:
	•	Convert text to lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords, and whitespace.
	•	Stemming to standardize word forms.
	•	Matrix Generation:
	•	Document-Term Matrix (DTM) and Term-Document Matrix (TDM) creation.
	•	Sparse term removal to focus on significant terms.
	•	Clustering:
	•	Hierarchical clustering using Euclidean and cosine distance metrics.
	•	Dendrogram visualization of clustering results.
	•	TF-IDF Weighting:
	•	Apply Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to prioritize significant terms.
	•	Cluster Analysis:
	•	Identify and visualize text clusters.

 How It Works

	1.	Text Preprocessing:
	•	Text is cleaned and normalized by:
	•	Converting to lowercase.
	•	Removing punctuation, stopwords, and whitespace.
	•	Stemming words to their base forms.
	•	The cleaned text is stored in a corpus for further processing.
	2.	Matrix Creation:
	•	A Document-Term Matrix (DTM) and Term-Document Matrix (TDM) are generated.
	•	Sparse terms are removed to reduce noise and improve clustering accuracy.
	3.	Clustering:
	•	Hierarchical clustering is performed using distance metrics such as Euclidean and cosine similarity.
	•	Text comments are grouped into clusters based on similarity.
	4.	Visualization:
	•	Results are visualized with dendrograms, showing the hierarchy of clusters.
	•	Clusters are labeled and analyzed for topic discovery.

 Future Improvements

	•	Dynamic Cluster Count:
	•	Automate the selection of the optimal number of clusters using methods like the silhouette score.
	•	Topic Modeling:
	•	Integrate LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to enhance topic discovery within clusters.
	•	Enhanced Preprocessing:
	•	Add named entity recognition and n-grams for more context in clustering.
	•	Interactive Visualization:
	•	Use libraries like shiny or plotly for interactive dendrograms and cluster exploration.
